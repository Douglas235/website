title: Clusterpedia with kubectl support to retrieve multicluster resources
date: 2021-12-03
---
This name Clusterpedia is inspired by Wikipedia. It is an encyclopedia of multi-cluster to synchronize, search for, and simply control multi-cluster resources.  Clusterpedia can synchronize resources with multiple clusters and provide more powerful search features on the basis of compatibility with Kubernetes OpenAPI to help you effectively get any multi-cluster resource that you are looking for in a quick and easy way.  


> The capability of Clusterpedia is not only to search for and view but also simply control resources in the future, just like Wikipedia that supports for editing entries.

## Architecture <span id="design"></span>
The architecture diagram of Clusterpedia is as follows:
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/clusterpedia-io/clusterpedia/blob/main/docs/images/arch.png?raw=true" style="width:900px;" /></div>
The architecture consists of four parts:

* **Clusterpedia APIServer**: Register to Kube APIServer by the means of Aggregated API and provide services through a unified entrance
* **ClusterSynchro Manager**: Manage the Cluster Synchro that is used to synchronize cluster resources
* **Storage Layer**: Connect with a specific storage component and then register to Clusterpedia APIServer and ClusterSynchro Manager via a storage interface
* **Storage component**: A specific storage facility such as MySQL, postgres, redis or other graph databases

In addition, Clusterpedia will use the custom resource *PediaCluster* to implement cluster authentication and synchronize the resource configuration.

Clusterpedia also provides a default storage layer that can connect with MySQL and postgres.
> Clusterpedia does not care about the specific storage settings used by users,
> you can choose or implement the storage layer according to your own needs and then register the storage layer in Clusterpedia as a plug-in

### Features<span id="features"></span>

> The above unimplemented features are already in the [Roadmap](#roadmap)

## Deployment<span id="deployment"></span>
For details on the deployment process, see [Instaling Clusterpedia](/docs/installation), which highlights how to use clusterpedia.

## Synchronize cluster resources<span id="get"></span>
After deploying clusterpedia crds, you can use kubectl to operate *PediaCluster* resources.
```sh
$ kubectl get pediaclusters
```
In the examples directory, you can check examples of *PediaCluster*:
```yaml
apiVersion: clusters.clusterpedia.io/v1alpha1
kind: PediaCluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-example
spec:
  apiserverURL: "https://10.30.43.43:6443"
  caData: ""
  tokenData: ""
  certData: ""
  keyData: ""
  resources:
  - group: apps
    resources:
     - deployments
  - group: ""
    resources:
     - pods
```
The configuration of *PediaCluster* can be divided into two parts:
* **Cluster authentication**
* **Synchronize a specific resource `.spec.resources`**
### Cluster authentication
The fields of `caData`, `tokenData`, `certData`, and `keyData` can be used for cluster verification.
> Currently it does not support for getting the relevant verification information from ConfigMap or Secret.
> However, the information is already in the [Roadmap](#roadmap).

When setting the verification field, you shall use the strings encoded by base64.

The `. /examples` directory provides the rbac yaml `clusterpedia_synchro_rbac.yaml`, which can be used to easily obtain the permission token for a subcluster.

Deploy the yaml in the subcluster and get the proper token and CA certificate.

```sh
$ # Switch to the sub-cluster to create rbac related resources
$ kubectl apply -f examples/clusterpedia_synchro_rbac.yaml
$ SYNCHRO_TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret $(kubectl get serviceaccount clusterpedia-synchro -o jsonpath='{.secrets[0].name}') -o jsonpath='{.data.token}')
$ SYNCHRO_CA=$(kubectl get secret $(kubectl get serviceaccount clusterpedia-synchro -o jsonpath='{.secrets[0].name}') -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}')
```
Copy *./examples/pediacluster.yaml*, modify `.spec.apiserverURL` and `.metadata.name` fields, and fill `$SYNCHRO_TOKEN` and `$SYNCHRO_CA` into `tokenData` and `caData`.
```sh
$ kubectl apply -f cluster-1.yaml
pediacluster.clusters.clusterpedia.io/cluster-1 created
```
### Synchronize resources
You can specify the synchronized resources by setting `group` in the `spec.resources` field and the `resources` section under `group`.

You can also view the resource synchronization status in the `status` section:
```sh
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2021-12-02T04:00:45Z"
    message: ""
    reason: Healthy
    status: "True"
    type: Ready
  resources:
  - group: ""
    resources:
    - kind: Pod
      namespaced: true
      resource: pods
      syncConditions:
      - lastTransitionTime: "2021-12-02T04:00:45Z"
        status: Syncing
        storageVersion: v1
        version: v1
  - group: apps
    resources:
    - kind: Deployment
      namespaced: true
      resource: deployments
      syncConditions:
      - lastTransitionTime: "2021-12-02T04:00:45Z"
        status: Syncing
        storageVersion: v1
        version: v1
  version: v1.22.2
```
## Search for resources<span id="view"></span>
After configuring the resources to be synchronized, you can search for the cluster resources. Clusterpedia supports two types of resource search:
* Search for resources that are compatible with Kubernetes OpenAPI
* Search for `Collection Resource`
```sh
$ kubectl api-resources | grep pedia.clusterpedia.io
collectionresources     pedia.clusterpedia.io/v1alpha1  false   CollectionResource
resources               pedia.clusterpedia.io/v1alpha1  false   Resources
```

In order to facilitate and well use kubectl for searching, you'd better create a 'shortcut' for searching the sub-cluster through `make gen-clusterconfig`:
```sh
$ make gen-clusterconfigs
./hack/gen-clusterconfigs.sh
Current Context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes
Current Cluster: kubernetes
        Server: https://10.6.11.11:6443
        TLS Server Name:
        Insecure Skip TLS Verify:
        Certificate Authority:
        Certificate Authority Data: ***
Cluster "clusterpedia" set.
Cluster "cluster-1" set.
```
Use the `kubectl config get-clusters` command to view the currently supported clusters.

In this case, Clusterpedia is a special cluster used to search for multi-clusters by using `kubectl --cluster clusterpedia`.

### Multi-cluster resource search
First check which resources are synchronized. You cannot find a resource until it is properly synchronized:
```sh
$ kubectl --cluster clusterpedia api-resources
NAME          SHORTNAMES   APIVERSION   NAMESPACED   KIND
pods          po           v1           true         Pod
deployments   deploy       apps/v1      true         Deployment
```
You can check the currently synchronized resources including pods and deployments.apps.

**Get deployments in the `kube-system` namespace of all clusters:**
```sh
$ kubectl --cluster clusterpedia get deployments -n kube-system
CLUSTER     NAME                      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
cluster-1   coredns                   2/2     2            2           68d
cluster-2   calico-kube-controllers   1/1     1            1           64d
cluster-2   coredns                   2/2     2            2           64d
```
**Get deployments in the two namespaces `kube-system` and `default` of all clusters:**
```sh
$ kubectl --cluster clusterpedia get deployments -A -l "search.clusterpedia.io/namespaces in (kube-system, default)"
NAMESPACE     CLUSTER     NAME                      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE

```

**Get deployments in the `kube-system` and `default` namespaces in cluster-1 and cluster-2:**

```
### Search a specific cluster
**If you want to search a specific cluster for any resource therein, you can add --cluster to specify the cluster name:**
```sh
$ kubectl --cluster cluster-1 get deployments -A
NAMESPACE                           CLUSTER     NAME                                            READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE

```
Except for `search.clusterpedia.io/clusters`, the support for other complex queries is same as that for multi-cluster search.

If you want to learn about the details of a resource, you need to specify which cluster it is:
```sh
$ kubectl --cluster cluster-1 -n kube-system get deployments coredns -o wide
CLUSTER     NAME      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE   CONTAINERS   IMAGES                                                   SELECTOR
cluster-1   coredns   2/2     2            2           68d   coredns      registry.aliyuncs.com/google_containers/coredns:v1.8.4   k8s-app=kube-dns
```
### Complex search
Clusterpedia supports for the following complex search:
* Specify one or more `cluster names`
* Specify one or more `namespaces`
* Specify one or more `resource names`
* Specify how to `sort` multiple fields
* `Paging` function, by which you can specify its size and offset
* `filter by labels`

The actual effect of field sorting depends on the storage layer. By default, the storage layer supports for sorting according to `cluster`, `name`, `namespace`, `created_at`, and `resource_version` in a normal or reverse order.
### How search conditions are applied
The above example demonstrates how you can use kubectl to search for resources. Where, complex search conditions are applied via a `label`. Clusterpedia also supports for using these search conditions directly through `url query`.

|role|label key|url query|example|
|---|---|---|---|
|Specified resource name|search.clusterpedia.io/names|names|`?names=pod-1,pod-2`
|Specified namespace|search.clusterpedia.io/namespaces|namespaces|`?namespaces=kube-system,default`
|Specified cluster name|search.clusterpedia.io/clusters|clusters|`?clusters=cluster-1,cluster-2`
|Sort by specified fileds|search.clusterpedia.io/orderby|orderby|`?orderby=name desc,namespace`
|Specified size |search.clusterpedia.io/size|size|`?size=100`
|Specified offset |search.clsuterpedia.io/offset|offset|`?offset=10`

The operators of `label key` include ==, =, !=, in, not in. For the `size` condition, kubectl can specify a size by `--chunk-size` instead of the `label key`.

### Collection Resource
Clusterpedia can also perform more advanced aggregation of resources. For example, you can use `Collection Resource` to get a set of different resources at once.

Let's first check which `Collection Resource` currently Clusterpedia supports:
```sh
$ kubectl get collectionresources
NAME        RESOURCES
workloads   deployments.apps,daemonsets.apps,statefulsets.apps
```

By getting workloads, you can get a set of resources aggregated by deployment, daemonset, and statefulset, and `Collection Resource` also supports for all complex queries.

**`kubectl get collectionresources workloads` will get the corresponding resources of all namespaces in all clusters by default:**
```sh
$ kubectl get collectionresources workloads
CLUSTER     GROUP   VERSION   KIND         NAMESPACE                     NAME                                          AGE

Due to the limitation of kubectl, you cannot use complex queries in kubectl and can only be queried by `url query`.

## Proposal
### Perform more complex control over resources<span id="complicated"></span>
In addition to resource search, similar to Wikipedia, Clusterpedia should also have simple capability of resource control, such as watch, create, delete, update, and more.

In fact, a write action is implemented by double write + response.

**We will discuss this feature and decide whether we should implement it according to the community needs**

### Automatic discovery and resource synchronization<span id="discovery"></span>
The resource used to represent the cluster in Clusterpedia is called *PediaCluster*, not a simple Cluster.

**This is because Clusterpedia was originally designed to build on the existing multi-cluster management platform. **

In order to keep the original intention, the first issue is that Clusterpedia should not conflict with the resources in the existing multi-cluster platform. Cluster is a very common resource name that represents a cluster.

In addition, in order to better connect with the existing multi-cluster platform and enable the connected clusters automatically complete resource synchronization, we need a new mechanism to discover clusters. This discovery mechanism needs to solve the following issues:
* Get the authentication info to access the cluster
* Configure conditions that trigger the lifecycle of PediaCluster
* Set the default policy and prefix name for resource synchronization

This feature will be discussed and implemented in detail in Q1 or Q2 2022.

## Roadmap<span id="roadmap"></span>
Currently, it is only a tentative roadmap and the specific schedule depends on the community needs.

**About some features not added to Roadmap, you can discuss in [issues](https://github.com/clusterpedia-io/clusterpedia/issues).**

### Q4 2021
* [Support for cropping field](https://github.com/clusterpedia-io/clusterpedia/issues/4)
* Synchronize custom resources

### Q1 2022
* Support for the plug-in storage layer
* Implement [automatic discovery and resource synchronization](#discovery)

### Q2 2022
* Support for [more control over cluster resources](#complicated), such as watch/create/update/delete operations
* The storage layer supports for custom Collection Resource by default
* Support for requests with relevant resources

## Remarks
### Multi-cluster network connectivity
Clusterpedia does not actually solve the problem of network connectivity in a multi-cluster environment. You can use tools such as [tower](https://github.com/kubesphere/tower) to connect and access sub-clusters, or use [submariner](https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner) or [skupper](https://github.com/skupperproject/skupper) to solve cross-cluster network problems.
